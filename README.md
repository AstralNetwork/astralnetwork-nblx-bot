# First Of All

Requirements
- Visual Studio Code
- Node JS ( https://nodejs.org/en/ )
- Average knowledge of JavaScript, If you don't, it might be a little bit harder but you can learn it anytime!
- Issues? Contact me, astralnetwork#4060 on discord.

First, download the files.
Open it on Visual Studio Code.
Also I highly suggest that you turn on Auto Save, hop on VSC, Go to File, scroll down and click on Autosave.
Open config.json and add the tokens, cookies and prefix yourself.
Run `npm start` or `node .` on your terminal (In Visual Studio Code).
*Voila!* Bot is running. Though you need a hosting to make it go online 24/7, I suggest Heroku
