By yours truly, AstralNetwork 

# Firstly

Requirements
- Visual Studio Code
- Node JS ( https://nodejs.org/en/ )
- Average knowledge of JavaScript, If you don't, it might be a little bit harder but you can learn it anytime! (you just need to have the will to do so)
- Issues? Contact me, astralnetwork#4060 on discord.

First, download the files.
Open it on Visual Studio Code.
Also I highly suggest that you turn on Auto Save, hop on VSC, Go to File, scroll down and click on Autosave.
Open config.json and add the tokens, cookies and prefix yourself.
Run `npm start` or `node .` on your terminal (In Visual Studio Code).
*Voila!* Bot is running. Though you need a hosting to make it go online 24/7, I personally suggest Heroku. More info on it ( https://anidiots.guide/hosting )

# Notes

- Read noblox.js documentation beforehand ( https://noblox.js.org/ )
- It's very simple to set up. Configurations are in config.json file
- I also made a colors.json file (no idea why, was hoping to make more colors soo, it might be convenient to some of you?)
- Please read the license
- I'm looking forward to open source more in the future, to help the community!
- Giving me credits or not, I don't mind. As long as you don't do anything bad with my name.
